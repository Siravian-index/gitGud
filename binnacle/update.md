23 days have passed since I decided to grasp the fundamentals and beyond of git.
I can say I have improved a lot during these weeks.
I am more confident at the moment of applying changes and moving around branches.

Besides, I have also get to know a bit better Github's layout. So, the same applies here regarding being more comfortable and confident at the moment of creating pull request and assigning issues.
